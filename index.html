If passed you will have to go through a training course that will run for a couple of weeks for legal reasons and to help you understand your role better and how to interact and react to certain situations that you might find yourself in while being a peer leader. After this mandatory training course lead by Ms. Haberman, you will be labeled as an official Peer Leader in Bard and will be assigned either an hour throughout the day or a students contact ID based off of what works best for you. </p> </a>

<h class="h2moreinfo"> The role of a peer listener! </h>
<a name="infopeer"><p class="moreinfo1"> As a Peer Listener, your role is to foster emotional well-being to those who reach out through the online anonymous site and any other peer-to-peer interactions that you might coordinate with your partner if comfortable. Your task is to be available to discuss any and all questions, conversations, and issues as long as they don't involve anything regarding physical harm or things regarding mental health that should be taken up with a trained professional. Peer Listeners are trained in a variety of areas including listening skills, problem-solving, and crisis management.
