<h class="h2moreinfo"> What it takes to be a peer listener! </h>

<br /> <br />
<p class="moreinfo1"> To become a peer leader you must first complete this form which will then be either passed or denied by Ms. Haberman. If passed you will have to go through a training course that will run for a couple of weeks for legal reasons and to help you understand your role better and how to interact and react to certain situations that you might find yourself in while being a peer leader. After this mandatory training course lead by Ms. Haberman, you will be labeled as an official Peer Leader in Bard and will be assigned either an hour throughout the day or a students contact ID based off of what works best for you. </p> </a>

<br />



<h class="h2moreinfo"> The role of a peer listener! </h>
<p class="moreinfo1"> As a Peer Listener, your role is to foster emotional well-being to those who reach out through the online anonymous site and any other peer-to-peer interactions that you might coordinate with your partner if comfortable. Your task is to be available to discuss any and all questions, conversations, and issues as long as they don't involve anything regarding physical harm or things regarding mental health that should be taken up with a trained professional. Peer Listeners are trained in a variety of areas including listening skills, problem-solving, and crisis management.</p> </a>

<br />

<h class="h2moreinfo"> What a peer listener's role is not! </h>
<p class="moreinfo1">A peer listener is not a therapist, you are not to deal with situations that go beyond the training provided and are not to try to solve them, you must also try to remove yourself from any bias or opinions that might interfere in the conversation since this is of course a free open space to discuss topics that might be sensitive or harder to talk about in person. There is a reason that students are coming to this program to be in contact with a peer that can listen and talk to them, please keep that in mind when discussing a topic that may be controversial or sensitive.</p>

<h class="h2moreinfo"> Confidentiality throughout the program!</h>
<p class="moreinfo1"> While communicating with peer listeners in this program, the conversation that takes place with be completely confidential between the two participants. The peer listener will not know who they are talking to at anytime and vice versa unless they decide to discuss that between themselves or if the student wants to set up an in person meeting with a peer listener. Due to legal reasons if a student brings up something that concerns their physical or mental health to an extent which could be dangerous to them or the environment around them then the messages will be presented to higher up administration.</p>
